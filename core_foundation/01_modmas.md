# **Order of Operations (BODMAS)**

## **1. Definition**
The **Order of Operations** is a set of rules in mathematics that determines the correct sequence in which different operations should be performed in a calculation.  
Following these rules ensures that everyone arrives at the same, correct answer for a given expression.

The acronym **BODMAS** helps remember the order:

| Letter | Stands For | Meaning |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **B** | **Brackets** | Solve everything inside brackets first. Includes `()`, `[]`, `{}`, and vinculum (fraction bar or radical line). |
| **O** | **Orders** | Handle powers (exponents), roots (square roots, cube roots, etc.), and indices. |
| **D** | **Division** | Perform division from left to right. |
| **M** | **Multiplication** | Perform multiplication from left to right (same priority as division). |
| **A** | **Addition** | Perform addition from left to right. |
| **S** | **Subtraction** | Perform subtraction from left to right (same priority as addition). |

## **2. Why It Matters**
Without a standard order, the same expression could produce different results depending on the sequence chosen.  
BODMAS ensures **consistency** and **accuracy** in all mathematical calculations.

## **3. Detailed Explanation**

### **Step 1: Brackets (B)**
- Solve expressions inside brackets first.
- If there are multiple types of brackets, work from the **innermost** to the **outermost**.

Example:  
\[
8 \times (3 + 2) = 8 \times 5 = 40
\]

---

### **Step 2: Orders (O)**
- Handle exponents, powers, and roots after brackets.

Example:  
\[
2^3 + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12
\]

---

### **Step 3: Division (D) and Multiplication (M)**
- These have **equal priority**.
- Perform them **from left to right** as they appear.

Example:  
\[
20 \div 5 \times 2 = 4 \times 2 = 8
\]

---

### **Step 4: Addition (A) and Subtraction (S)**
- These also have **equal priority**.
- Perform them **from left to right**.

Example:  
\[
10 - 3 + 2 = 7 + 2 = 9
\]

---

## **4. Complete Example**

**Expression:**  
\[
7 + 3 \times (10 - 6)^2 \div 2
\]

**Solution using BODMAS:**
1. **Brackets:** \( 10 - 6 = 4 \)  
   → \( 7 + 3 \times (4)^2 \div 2 \)  
2. **Orders:** \( 4^2 = 16 \)  
   → \( 7 + 3 \times 16 \div 2 \)  
3. **Division & Multiplication (left to right):**  
   \( 3 \times 16 = 48 \)  
   \( 48 \div 2 = 24 \)  
   → \( 7 + 24 \)  
4. **Addition:** \( 7 + 24 = 31 \) ✅

**Final Answer:**  
\[
\boxed{31}
\]

---

## **5. Common Mistakes to Avoid**
- **Ignoring left-to-right rule** for multiplication/division or addition/subtraction.
- **Skipping brackets** or solving them out of order.
- **Misinterpreting orders** (e.g., forgetting that roots are part of "Orders").

---

## **6. Quick Practice Problems**
Try solving these using BODMAS:

1. \( 5 + 2 \times 3 \)  
2. \( (8 + 4) \div 2 \)  
3. \( 6 + 12 \div (3 \times 2) \)  
4. \( (5^2 - 9) \times 2 \)  
5. \( 100 \div 5 \times (2 + 3) \)
