## ðŸ”¹ Arithmetic Progression (AP)
An **Arithmetic Progression** is a sequence of numbers where the **difference between consecutive terms is constant**.

### General Form
```
a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, â€¦ 
```
- **a** = first term  
- **d** = common difference  

### nth Term Formula
\[
a_n = a + (n-1)d
\]

### Sum of First n Terms
\[
S_n = \frac{n}{2} \big[2a + (n-1)d\big]
\]
or equivalently,
\[
S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a + l)
\]
where **l** is the last term.

âœ… **Example**:  
AP = 3, 7, 11, 15, â€¦  
- Here, \(a = 3\), \(d = 4\).  
- 5th term: \(a_5 = 3 + (5-1) \cdot 4 = 19\).  
- Sum of first 5 terms: \(S_5 = \frac{5}{2}[2\cdot3 + (5-1)\cdot4] = 55\).

## ðŸ”¹ Geometric Progression (GP)
A **Geometric Progression** is a sequence where each term is obtained by **multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio**.

### General Form
```
a, ar, arÂ², arÂ³, â€¦
```
- **a** = first term  
- **r** = common ratio  

### nth Term Formula
\[
a_n = a \cdot r^{n-1}
\]

### Sum of First n Terms
If \(r \neq 1\):
\[
S_n = \frac{a(r^n - 1)}{r - 1}
\]

If \(r = 1\):
\[
S_n = n \cdot a
\]

### Sum of Infinite GP
If \(|r| < 1\):
\[
S_\infty = \frac{a}{1-r}
\]

âœ… **Example**:  
GP = 2, 6, 18, 54, â€¦  
- Here, \(a = 2\), \(r = 3\).  
- 4th term: \(a_4 = 2 \cdot 3^{3} = 54\).  
- Sum of first 4 terms: \(S_4 = \frac{2(3^4 - 1)}{3 - 1} = 80\).

## ðŸ”‘ Why AP & GP Matter in DSA
- **AP** shows up in problems involving **linear growth** (e.g., sum of first n natural numbers, distributing tasks, loop iterations).  
- **GP** shows up in problems involving **exponential growth** (e.g., binary trees, powers of 2, compound interest, algorithm complexity like O(log n)).  
- Many **mathematical tricks** in coding contests rely on quickly recognizing AP/GP patterns to avoid brute force.

âš¡ Quick DSA Connection:
- **AP**: Sum of first n natural numbers â†’ \(n(n+1)/2\).  
- **GP**: Number of nodes in a complete binary tree of height h â†’ \(2^{h+1} - 1\).

## âš¡ Pro Tips for Contests
- Memorize **AP sums** for natural, odd, and even numbers.  
- Recognize **GP patterns** in binary trees, recursion, and logarithmic complexity.  
- When stuck, check if the sequence is **linear (AP)** or **exponential (GP)**.  
- For large n, use **modular arithmetic** (common in coding contests).
